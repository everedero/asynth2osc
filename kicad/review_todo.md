* [DONE] Check STM32 GPIO mux against datasheet (done with STM32Cube)
* [DONE] Check all STM32 power supplies (datasheet)
* [DONE] Review power stages and current capability for critical components
* [DONE] Verify all nets go somewhere (no 3V3 and 3v3 net)
- Export Kicad netlist
- grep -i "net" asynthosc.net
* [DONE] Check Ethernet against ref design

* [DONE] Verify custom components and footprints (especially pinout)
* [DONE] Verify capacitors are close to pins - and preferably, the right capacitors close to the right pins

* [DONE] Make sure power planes are wide enough
* [DONE] Check ackward, ugly plane zones and antennae

* [DONE] Silkscreen review

* [DONE] Check BOM availability
* [DONE] Attribute _generic_ components to real references
* DFM + 3D check on JLC DFM and complete BOM / assembly
