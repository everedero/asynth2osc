* Check STM32 GPIO mux against datasheet (done with STM32Cube)
* Check all STM32 power supplies (datasheet)
* Review power stages and current capability for critical components
* Verify all nets go somewhere
* Check Ethernet against ref design

* Verify custom components and footprints (especially pinout)

* Check BOM availability
* Attribute _generic_ components to real references
* DFM + 3D check on JLC DFM and complete BOM / assembly
